Code for calculating infinite projected entangle-pair state (iPEPS) quantum tensor-network states based on the corner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) algorithm using LibTorch and automatic differentiation.

Based on the Python implementation: [github.com/wangleiphy/tensorgrad](https://github.com/wangleiphy/tensorgrad).
